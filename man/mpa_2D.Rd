\title{Spatial MPA simulation}
\usage{
mpa_2D(area, nsteps, r, pop0, K, mrate)
}
\arguments{
\item{area}{an N by M matrix with harvesting rates for fishing grounds (0 < harvesting rate <= 1) and MPAs (harvesting rate = 0) for the simulated area.}

\item{nsteps}{Number of steps to run the simulation.}

\item{r}{Intrinsic population growth rate.}

\item{pop0}{Initial population size. If single, assumes equal population size across all cells in area. If a matrix, it must have the same dimensions as area.}

\item{K}{Carrying capacity}

\item{mrate}{Movement rate expressed as a proportion (relative to 1). Indicates the proportion of organisms that will move out of a cell in one timestep.}
}
\value{
results A list containing pop: a matrix of size N by M (same dimensions as area, above) with population size within each cell; and timeseries: a dataframe with 4 columns and nstep rows. The columns contain time (timeseries$time), population size inside the MPA (timeseries$pop.in), population size outside the MPA (timeseries$pop.out) and yearly total catches (timeseries$total.catches).

Simulates MPA and surrounding fishing grounds.
